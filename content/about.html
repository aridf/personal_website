<p>I am a PhD student in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy. I hold an MSc in <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2020/MSc-Inequalities-and-Social-Science">Inequalities and Social Science</a> from the London School of Economics and a BA in Psychology from the <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">University of Winnipeg</a>. I am currently visiting the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, as part of a research incubator program. For the fall semester I am interning at Spotify.</p>
<p>I am interested in a lot of things. Here is what I’ve thought about most lately:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Computational demography</p></li>
<li><p>Using non-representative data to study populations</p></li>
<li><p>Machine learning for demographic measurement</p></li>
<li><p>Software development</p></li>
<li><p>The need for stakeholder engagement in data science work</p></li>
</ul>
