<p>I am a PhD student in Cornell’s Policy Analysis and Management program. I hold an MSc in Inequalities and Social Science from the London School of Economics and a BA in Psychology from the University of Winnipeg. Before starting at Cornell, I worked for two years as a data scientist and product manager at the people analytics firm Multi Health Systems Inc. I have experience in computational social science, product management, and team leadership.</p>
<p>I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Computational social science</p></li>
<li><p>Travelling</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusive economic growth</p></li>
<li><p>Coding</p></li>
<li><p>The role of data in public policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For those who want to learn more about my journey, I’ve written a <a href="https://aridecterfrain.com/posts/ari-career-background/">blog post</a> which may be informative.</p>
