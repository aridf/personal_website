<p>I am a PhD student in Cornell’s Policy Analysis and Management program. I received my MSc from the London School of Economics and my undergradute degree from the University of Winnipeg. Before starting at Cornell, I spent two years working in people analytics at Multi Health Systems Inc. I have experience in quantitative and experimental social science, product development, and business strategy.</p>
<p>I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quantitative social science</p></li>
<li><p>Coding</p></li>
<li><p>Travelling</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting evidence-based decision-making in policy and business</p></li>
</ul>
