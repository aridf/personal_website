<p>I am a PhD student in Cornell’s Policy Analysis and Management program. During the summer of 2020 I served as a <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/2020-data-science-for-social-good-projects">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://escience.washington.edu">University of Washington’s eScience Institute</a>. I hold an MSc in <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2020/MSc-Inequalities-and-Social-Science">Inequalities and Social Science</a> from the London School of Economics and a BA in Psychology from the <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">University of Winnipeg</a>. I have also worked for two years as a data scientist and product manager at a people analytics firm called <a href="https://mhs.com/">Multi Health Systems Inc.</a></p>
<p>I am interested about a lot of things. Here is what I’ve thought about most lately:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Computational demography</p></li>
<li><p>Election fairness</p></li>
<li><p>Software development</p></li>
<li><p>The need for stakeholder engagement in data science work</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Traveling</h2>
<p>I like to travel. I especially like to stay for extended periods to get a feel for daily life. I made a map of all the places I have gone so far, mostly to hold myself accountable for filling in the rest. Here is my progress so far:</p>
