<p>I am a PhD candidate in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy, where I do research in economics and demography using computational methods. I have also interned as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika Technologies</a>, and as a Research Scientist at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/?">Spotify</a>. I am currently seeking roles in the private sector. I hold an MSc in <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2020/MSc-Inequalities-and-Social-Science">Inequalities and Social Science</a> from the London School of Economics and a BA in Psychology from the <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">University of Winnipeg</a>.</p>
