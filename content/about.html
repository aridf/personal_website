<p>I am a PhD student in Cornell’s Policy Analysis and Management program. I received my MSc from the London School of Economics and my BA (Hons.) from the University of Winnipeg. Before starting at Cornell, I spent two years working in the field of people analytics at Multi Health Systems Inc. I have experience in quantitative and experimental social science, product development, and business strategy.</p>
<p>I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quantitative social science</p></li>
<li><p>Business strategy</p></li>
<li><p>Coding</p></li>
<li><p>Travelling</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a more fair, inclusive economy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you care to learn more about me, I’ve written a blog post about the my experiences at each step of my career journey. You can find it on my posts page.</p>
