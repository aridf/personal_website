<p>Through policy, governments set the rules of the game that all firms and workers play. I want to change the rules so that the game gives fairer rewards and everyone has a more equal chance at success.</p>
<p>Why do people flock to major cities despite ever-rising costs of living? Why is competition declining across industries? How did elite education become a necessary and sufficient condition for economic success?</p>

I don’t expect to answer every question. I’m here gain the methodological tools I need to find the truth and create solutions.</p>
