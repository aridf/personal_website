I am a PhD student in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy. I hold an MSc in [Inequalities and Social Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2020/MSc-Inequalities-and-Social-Science) from the London School of Economics and a BA in Psychology from the [University of Winnipeg](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/). I am currently visiting the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, as part of a research incubator program. For the fall semester I am interning at Spotify.

I am interested in a lot of things. Here is what I've thought about most lately:

* Computational demography

* Using non-representative data to study populations

* Machine learning for demographic measurement

* Software development

* The need for stakeholder engagement in data science work

## Timeline

_**Fall 2022**_

* Research Intern @ Spotify!!

_**Summer 2022**_

* Working on mortality prediction and survival modelling at MPIDR in Rostock ([link to program](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_events_6123/news_press_releases_4630/news/population_and_social_data_science_summer_incubator_program_10619)).
