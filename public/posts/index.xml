			<description>University of WinnipegI completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Winnipeg. While studying I worked in Dr. Jeremy Frimer’s Moral Psychology lab. We used experiments and natural language processing to study:
The psychological differences between liberals and conservatives.The determinants of public approval of governing bodies, specifically US Congress.How leaders emerge and interact with social movements.I also studied philosophy. I discovered the liberal views of John Stuart Mill, John Rawls and Amartya Sen, which continue to guide my beliefs about morality and politics today.</description>

<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Winnipeg. While studying I worked in Dr. Jeremy Frimer’s Moral Psychology lab. We used experiments and natural language processing to study:</p>

<li>The psychological differences between liberals and conservatives.</li>
<li>The determinants of public approval of governing bodies, specifically US Congress.</li>
<li>How leaders emerge and interact with social movements.</li>

<h3>London School of Economics</h3>
<p>I spent the next year in London completing my MSc in Inequalities and Social Science. I learned how globalization and technological change - changes in the rules of the game - had produced rising inequality in high-income countries.</p>
<p>LSE presents all kinds of opportunities to learn and have new experiences. I tried to take on as many as I could. I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attended public lectures regularly.</li>
<li>Took quant methods courses from some of the world’s best social scientists.</li>
<li>Served as team leader for a student consulting project.</li>
<li>Took my first coding course and fell completely in love with it.</li>
<li>Made lifelong friendships with the members of my brilliant, inspiring cohort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the year I was exposed to full the scope and diversity of opportunities that lay ahead. It changed my life.</p>

<h3>Multi Health Systems</h3>
<p>After graduating from LSE I moved to Toronto and joined Multi Health Systems as a research analyst in their Innovation Hub, the company’s internal startup. In this role I did mostly data science work and developed my skills coding in R, HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>After a year I became a product manager. I led a small team working on feature updates for the products in our portfolio, and I worked closely with the CEO of MHS to develop the business model for the company’s new product line in the workplace health and wellness market.</p>
<p>I learned a tremendous amount about business decision-making. cut through uncertainty with reasonable assumptions, how to decide which tasks to outsource, how to package products and services together to create value for customers while turning a profit.</p>
<p>At a systems level, I was also learning firsthand how businesses navigate markets.</p>
