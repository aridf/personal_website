I am a PhD student in Cornell's Policy Analysis and Management program. I received my MSc from the London School of Economics and my undergradute degree from the University of Winnipeg. Before starting at Cornell, I spent two years working in people analytics at Multi Health Systems Inc. I have experience in quantitative and experimental social science, product development, and business strategy. 

I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:

* Quantitative social science

* Coding

* Travelling

* Promoting evidence-based decision-making in policy and business

For those who want to learn more about me, I've written a [blog post](https://aridecterfrain.com/posts/ari-career-background/) which may be informative.
