I am a PhD student in Cornell's Policy Analysis and Management program. I have experience in research, product development, and business strategy. I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:

* Quantitative social science

* Business strategy

* Coding

* Travelling

* Creating a more fair, inclusive economy

If you care to learn more about me, I've written a blog post about my experiences along each step of my academic and professional journey so far. You can find it on my posts page.
