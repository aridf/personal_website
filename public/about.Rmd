I am a PhD student in Cornell's Policy Analysis and Management program. I received my MSc from the London School of Economics and my undergradute degree from the University of Winnipeg. Before starting at Cornell, I spent two years working in people analytics at Multi Health Systems Inc. I have experience in quantitative and experimental social science, product development, and business strategy. 

I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:

* Quantitative social science

* Business strategy

* Coding

* Travelling

* Creating a more fair, inclusive economy

For those who want to learn more about me, I've written a blog post about my experiences at each step of my career journey. You can find it on my posts page.
