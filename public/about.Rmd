I am a PhD student in Cornell's Policy Analysis and Management program. I hold an MSc in Inequalities and Social Science from the London School of Economics and a BA in Psychology from the University of Winnipeg. Before starting at Cornell, I worked for two years as a data scientist and product manager at the people analytics firm Multi Health Systems Inc. I have experience in computational social science, product management, and team leadership. 

I am passionate about a lot of things. Here is an abbreviated list in no particular order:

* Computational social science

* Travelling

* Inclusive economic growth

* Coding

* The role of data in public policy


For those who want to learn more about my journey, I've written a [blog post](https://aridecterfrain.com/posts/ari-career-background/) which may be informative.
