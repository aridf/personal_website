      <description>Through policy, governments set the rules of the game that all firms and workers play. I want to change the rules so that the game gives fairer rewards and everyone has a more equal chance at success.
Why do people flock to major cities despite ever-rising costs of living? Why is competition declining across industries? How did elite education become a necessary and sufficient condition for economic success?
Answering these questions requires accessing new kinds of data, revealing hidden social networks, identifying causal mechanisms, and understanding economic incentives.</description>
