      <description>My career so far has been a wonderfully ecclectic adventure. In this post I provide a brief summary of my experiences and how they led me to my current position at Cornell. The stated purpose of this post is to introduce myself to readers. The actual purpose is to help me sort through and organize my thoughts about my life.

      <description>Through policy, governments set the rules of the game that all firms and workers play. I want to change the rules so that the game gives fairer rewards and everyone has a more equal chance at success.
Why do people flock to major cities despite ever-rising costs of living? Why is competition declining across industries? How did elite education become a necessary and sufficient condition for economic success?
Answering these questions requires accessing new kinds of data, revealing hidden social networks, identifying causal mechanisms, and understanding economic incentives.</description>
